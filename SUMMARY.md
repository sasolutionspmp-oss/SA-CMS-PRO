SUMMARY SNAPSHOT - 2025-09-20T22:07:17Z (~305 words)

Task 1 (Tailwind build fix) is closed out: the frontend now relies on `@tailwindcss/postcss` instead of the direct `tailwindcss` PostCSS plugin call, which keeps Vite/PostCSS 8 happy and brings in the upstream Oxide optimizations we need for the upcoming Tailwind 4 feature set. The refreshed config (`frontend/postcss.config.js`) instantiates `tailwindcss()` from the scoped package and chains `autoprefixer()`, so class scanning continues to follow the glob defined in `frontend/tailwind.config.ts`. The semantic token matrix in `frontend/src/index.css` stays untouched; it still exposes the light/dark CSS variables and the base/components/utilities layers in the right order, and no FOUC surfaced during validation.

To give us an at-a-glance proving ground inside the dev shell, `frontend/src/components/dev/TailwindProbe.tsx` now renders a richer set of utilities: semantic status chips advertise the `@tailwindcss/postcss` handshake, while the gradient test card and layout grid exercise gradient, grid, spacing, focus-visible, and shadow utilities. Because the probe only wraps `<App />` when `import.meta.env.DEV` is truthy, production builds stay slim but local contributors immediately see whether Tailwind is compiling after future refactors.

Validation: `pnpm run build` completed in roughly 2.5s without PostCSS complaints, and a short `pnpm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5175 --clearScreen=false` smoke (terminated after warmup) showed Vite coming up cleanly even after dependency re-resolution. Those command outputs are logged in `PROGRESS.md` for replay. No additional lint or type issues appeared, so the change set is limited to the new dependency, the PostCSS config tweak, and the updated probe component.

Open items: none in the original backlogâ€”the last unchecked box in `TASKS.md` is now flipped to complete with the current timestamp. Follow-up ideas (non-blocking) include pulling the TailwindProbe styling into a dedicated Storybook-like showcase once we stand up component docs, and adding a small Vitest that mounts the probe to guard against future regressions in semantic token usage.
