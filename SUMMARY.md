SUMMARY SNAPSHOT — 2025-09-20T14:30Z (~320 words)

Resuming as lead engineer with the revised directive to execute the backlog from Task 20 downwards. The repository remains a hybrid of mature automation (numerous PowerShell lanes, PyInstaller packaging, documentation) and partially implemented product code. On the backend we have a FastAPI application under `apps/api` with routes for auth, intake, CRM, estimator, workflows, etc., tied together via SQLAlchemy models and shared services in `packages/core`. The frontend lives under `frontend/` (React 18, Vite, Tailwind) with an intake-focused `App.tsx` and preliminary theme/tailwind scaffolding. Large swaths of the ingest pipeline, workers, and advanced UI flows are still stubs; they will be tackled later as we progress upstream through the backlog.

Task 20 (Documentation) is now complete. README.md was rewritten to give a concise architecture overview, prerequisites, quick-start instructions (backend, worker, frontend), test commands, packaging steps, and log locations. A new `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` summarises the key FastAPI endpoint groups so engineers can cross-check contracts before building out further features. To keep the OpenAPI explorer organised, `apps/api/main.py` now defines explicit tag metadata (health, auth, account, orgs, bootstrap, intake, jobs, CRM, estimator, export, workflows) and attaches them to the FastAPI app, ensuring `/docs` and `/redoc` present coherent groupings for upcoming development. Python syntax validation (`python -m compileall apps/api/main.py`) succeeded after the refactor.

Housekeeping: `TASKS.md` was reconstructed after a bad write, preserving the previously completed Task 2 and 3 timestamps and marking Task 20 as done. Tasks 1 and 4–19 currently sit in “PENDING 2025-09-20T14:30Z” status; per the new guidance the execution order will be 19 → 18 → … → 1. `PROGRESS.md` records the documentation pass and tracker repair. The next milestone is Task 19 (Tests), which will require establishing realistic backend and frontend test harnesses that reflect the eventual ingest pipeline; once that is complete I will continue moving backward to Task 18 (dev scripts) and so on. No code has been committed yet—each future task will culminate in a focused commit once its acceptance criteria are met.
