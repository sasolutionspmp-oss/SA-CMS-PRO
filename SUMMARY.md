SUMMARY SNAPSHOT - 2025-09-21T00:44:13Z (~275 words)

Tailwind now has an automated sanity check. The dev-only probe grew `data-testid` hooks and richer coverage (`frontend/src/components/dev/TailwindProbe.tsx`), and a standalone Vite entry (`frontend/src/dev/tailwind-probe-entry.tsx` + `frontend/tailwind-probe.html`) renders it without pulling the full app stack. Playwright targets that page via `frontend/tests/e2e/tailwind-probe.spec.ts`, asserting the semantic chips, gradient card, and grid layout all survive the `@tailwindcss/postcss` pipeline by inspecting computed styles. The harness sets `VITE_TAILWIND_PROBE=1` in `frontend/playwright.config.ts` so contributors can still force the probe inside the primary shell when needed.

`import.meta.env.DEV` logic in `frontend/src/main.tsx` now honours that override while keeping production bundles clean. Because current App work-in-progress still throws "Cannot access 'intakeDisabled' before initialization", the test sidesteps the broken screen by leaning on the new standalone entry; the failing workflow spec remains logged for follow-up rather than ignored.

Commands run: `pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/tailwind-probe.spec.ts` (passing) and `pnpm exec playwright test tests/e2e/intake-workflow.spec.ts` (still timing out thanks to the pre-existing runtime error noted above). No additional backend or build commands were required after the earlier Tailwind pipeline verification.

Next attention items: unblock the App runtime regression so the original intake workflow e2e can go green again, and consider wiring the new probe entry into Storybook-style documentation once the component gallery comes online.
