SUMMARY SNAPSHOT - 2025-09-21T01:21:00Z (~280 words)

Task 5 tightened resilience around the metrics stack. The new shared helper (`packages/core/metrics.py`) now normalises responses, coerces malformed values into predictable shapes, and exposes `offline_metrics_payload` for any caller that needs a hardened “service unavailable” stub. `MetricsService` consumes that helper so missing JSON, invalid fallbacks, or disabled endpoints return structured offline snapshots instead of bubbling errors. The service still records fallback events via `emit_fallback_event`, but the payload now carries the stage label, message, and sanitised counters even when fixture data is absent. Regression coverage (`tests/unit/test_services.py::test_metrics_service_handles_partial_payload`) exercises the new path with half-populated JSON to prove the normaliser and fallback wiring produce stable snapshots.

On the UI side, a lightweight telemetry watcher (`frontend/src/hooks/useFallbackTelemetry.ts`) polls the `/intake/telemetry` endpoint and emits a Sonner warning toast whenever the backend records a new fallback. The watcher mounts once per shell render via `FallbackTelemetryWatcher` in `frontend/src/App.tsx`, keeping operators informed without crashing the intake screen. The same hook is available for future nav-badge integrations once we polish the intake module. A quick `pnpm run build` confirmed the React bundle still compiles with the new hook in place.

Earlier Tailwind hardening remains intact: the dev-only probe and Playwright coverage ensure the `@tailwindcss/postcss` pipeline is wired, while telemetry and metrics updates build on that baseline. Open risk: the intake Playwright workflow continues to trip over the pre-existing `intakeDisabled` initialisation bug; the new watcher surfaces the degraded mode so we can prioritise the fix.

Commands run today: `.\\.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe -m pytest tests\\unit\\test_services.py` and `pnpm run build` (from `frontend/`).

Next steps: investigate the intake boot regression so the original workflow spec passes again, extend nav badges to consume the telemetry hook, and consider reusing the shared normaliser inside any CLI or worker paths that still hand-roll metrics parsing.
